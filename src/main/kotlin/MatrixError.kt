/**An error container class that contains all the Errors the library can throw out.
 * @property SizeError An error that is thrown when the size of the matrix does not match the row and column count. For eg: This is thrown when a 3x3 matrix is initialized with a 4x4 array.
 * @property IndexOutOfBound An error that is thrown when the index given is out of bounds. For eg: This is thrown when Matrix.get(4,4) is called on a 3x3 or lower matrix.
 * @property NotSameSizeMatrix An Error that is thrown when the matrices are not of same size. For eg: This is thrown when addition is performed on a 2x3 and 3x2 matrix.
 * @property MultiplicationDimensionError An error that is thrown when the number of columns of 1st matrix doesn't match number of rows of 2nd matrix. For eg: This is thrown when matrix multiplication is performed on a 2x3 and 2x3 matrix.
 * @property NotSquareMatrix An error that is thrown when the matrix is not square. For eg: This is thrown when inverse() is called on a non-square matrix.
 * @property SizeTooSmall An error that is thrown when the matrix is too small to perform an operation. For eg: This is thrown when subSqMatrix() is called on a 1x1 matrix. It can't be divided further.
 * @property DimensionOutOfBounds An error that is thrown when the dimension(row, column) given is out of bounds. For eg: This is thrown when subSqMatrix(4,4) is called on a 3x3 or lower matrix.
 * @property NoSuchElement An error that is thrown when there is no next element to access. For eg: This is thrown when next() is called on an empty matrix.
 * @property SizeInvalid An error that is thrown when the size of the matrix is invalid. For eg: This is thrown when a 0x3 matrix is initialized or -1Ã—3 matrix is initialized.
