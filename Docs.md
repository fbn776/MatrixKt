# Documentations
All the documentation for the `MatrixKt` is available here. 
For staters see [readme](./README.md).

## Operators

`MatrixKt` provides multiple operators like `addition`, `subraction`, `scalar product`, `matrix product` etc.
MatrixKt also uses Kotlin's syntax systems to its advantage. `MatrixKt`'s operators extend the default operators like `+`, `-`, `*`, `/` etc.
